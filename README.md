# CoViD-19 Data Analysis

Some data analysis in python around the covid-19 data (including survival analysis with Kaplan-Meier).

Data Source: [CSSEGISandData/COVID-19](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19), the data behind the dashboard: [Coronavirus COVID-19 Global Cases by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU)](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6).

The first notebook just visualizes the numbers on a daily basis for a few regions: [covid-19-data-analysis.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/cs224/xxx.ipynb?flush_cache=true)

The second notebook does some survival analysis via Kaplan-Meier: [covid-19-survival.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/cs224/xxx.ipynb?flush_cache=true)
